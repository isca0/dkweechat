This project was inspired and some part based on https://github.com/kerwindena/docker-weechat

## Installation ##

This is very simple to run, you need to specify the full path of your ssh public key and set this path on
variable **pubkey**

E.g. ```$ set -a; export pubkey=/home/myuser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub;docker-compose up```

But here is a script to take this action even more simple, just run:

 ```
  ./setup.sh
 ```
Just run setup and it will guide you trough a simple steps and run this container :crystal_ball: automagically :crystal_ball:

## Manually

If you want to understant what it's dooing manually:

  * export pubkey=path_to_my_key
  * check if the volume weechat exist and if not  then create. (This volume is where your settings will be persisted)
  * check if you altready have a backup and if it exist restore them on weechat volume
  * docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
  
_Ps. the weechat volume name is hardcoded and if already have one volume with this same name it will create a data folder inside to use weechat_
