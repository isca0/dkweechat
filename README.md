Weechat is a nice IRC client and this project gives you a nice docker container to use weechat and all your scripts.

you are ready to stay live forever on a tmux stick session on all your favorite channels...

This project was inspired and some part based on https://github.com/kerwindena/docker-weechat

## Installation ##

This is a very simple project, all you need is basically an ssh public key, if dont have one yet,
you can make one with the command ```ssh-keygen```.
All wee need, is map your public ssh key on this docker container.
You can do this in several ways... The easy way is use the **setup.sh** script...

</p>

To take this action even more simple, just run:

 ```
  ./setup.sh run
 ```

Just run setup and it will guide you trough a simple steps and run this container :crystal_ball: automagically :crystal_ball:


## Manually

This is very simple to run, you need to specify the full path of your ssh public key and set this path on
variable **pubkey**

You can do like this:

E.g. ```$ set -a; export pubkey=/home/myuser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub;docker-compose up```

Or you can just place you full ssh public key path on docker-compose.yml on volumes group.

```
  volumes:
    - full_path_to_your_key:/home/weechat/.ssh/authorized_keys:ro

```

If you want to understant what it's dooing manually:

  * export pubkey=path_to_my_key
  * check if the volume weechat exist and if not  then create. (This volume is where your settings will be persisted)
  * check if you already have a backup and if it exist restore them on weechat volume
  * docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
  
_Ps. the weechat volume name is hardcoded and if already have one volume with this same name it will create a data folder inside to use weechat_
